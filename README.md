# Sign me up!

Your task is to improve on our example app

## 1. Convert the /token endpoint to a /login endpoint âœ…

- get a username and password from the request
- compare to an existing array of user objects 
- array of users in app memory, db can be added later
- return token only if user details are correct

## 2. Add registration âœ…

- add an endpoint to create a new user
- username must be unique
- hash the passwords!!

## 3. Add environment variables âœ…

- make sure not to commit .env
- make sure to commit an example .env
- make the secret, port and token expiration time come from env

## 4. **BONUS** 

- create a VERY simple frontend that uses our example app
- a single file with basic html+css+js; save the JWT to localstorage

## 5. **XTRA BONUS** 

- add a database connection for the users
